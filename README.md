# JOGO

JOGO is a tokenzier and parser for the LOGO (also known as [Turtle Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics)) Programming Languange. Its main purpose is to parse and tokenzie a logo language file. The tokenization can be parsed to another program, that handles the display for the steps of the turtle. The name JOGO is derived from the words <b>J</b>avaScript and  L<b>OGO</b>.
